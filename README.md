# Guess the Number !

This code will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask the user to guess the number. After each guess, the program will provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The game will continue until the user correctly guesses the number. Once the correct number is guessed, the program will display the number of attempts made.

## How to start ?

You can use this code as a starting point and add more features or enhancements to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
To run the game, you can create a new Java project and add these two files to the project. Then, execute the Main.java file, and the number guessing game will start. The user will be prompted to enter their guesses until they correctly guess the random number between 1 and 100.
